# filers_mcp_development_plan

<!--
This document is an exemplar for the level of detail and structure expected in development plans for the filers_mcp project. It is modeled after the style and depth of gritos_dev_plan.md.
-->

## 1. Development Phases and Milestones

### 1.1. Phase 1: Foundation and Security
- Implement core server structure and CLI entrypoint.
- Develop path validation and allowed directories enforcement.
- Integrate logging and audit mechanisms.
- Milestone: Secure, auditable server skeleton with path validation.

### 1.2. Phase 2: Core File and Directory Tools
- Implement read, write, create, move, and delete file operations.
- Implement directory listing, creation, move, and deletion.
- Add support for file head/tail and partial content reads.
- Milestone: All core file and directory tools functional and tested.

### 1.3. Phase 3: Protocol, Extensibility, and Testing
- Integrate MCP protocol handler and tool registration.
- Add protocol version negotiation and extension support.
- Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for all tools and validation logic.
- Milestone: Protocol-compliant, extensible, and fully tested server.

### 1.4. Phase 4: Deployment, Documentation, and Audit
- Prepare deployment scripts and configuration examples.
- Write user and developer documentation.
- Conduct security and audit review.
- Milestone: Production-ready release with full documentation and audit trail.

## 2. Task Decomposition and Parallelization

### 2.1. Task Swarms (Parallelizable)
- Path validation, logging, and CLI can be developed in parallel.
- File and directory tools can be implemented as independent tasks.
- Protocol integration and testing can proceed in parallel with documentation.

### 2.2. Example Task Breakdown
- Implement `AllowedPaths` struct and validation logic.
- Develop `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory` tools.
- Integrate logging and error reporting.
- Write unit tests for each tool and validation function.
- Prepare example configuration and deployment scripts.

---

## 3. Testing, Verification, and Validation

### 3.1. Unit and Integration Testing
- All tools and validation logic must have comprehensive unit tests.
- Integration tests for protocol compliance and security boundaries.

### 3.2. Join Task and Remediation Protocol
- At the end of each Task Swarm and Phase, perform join tasks to verify completion and correctness.
- If issues are found, generate remediation tasks and update the checklist.

### 3.3. Acceptance Criteria
- All requirements and constraints from the architecture are met.
- No critical or high-severity issues remain open.
- All tests pass and audit logs are complete.

---

## 4. Documentation and Handoff Protocols

### 4.1. Documentation
- User guide for configuration and operation.
- Developer guide for extending tools and protocol.
- Inline code documentation and examples.

### 4.2. Handoff and Checklist
- Generate a checklist file listing all tasks by phase and swarm.
- Each task updates its status (Complete, Partial, None) with notes.
- Handoff includes all documentation, test results, and audit logs.

---

## 5. Risk Management and Remediation

### 5.1. Risk Identification
- Security vulnerabilities in path validation or tool logic.
- Incomplete test coverage or audit logging.
- Protocol incompatibility or extension issues.

### 5.2. Mitigation Strategies
- Peer review and automated testing for all code.
- Strict adherence to architecture constraints.
- Iterative self-review and join task protocol.

### 5.3. Remediation Protocol
- If issues are found, create remediation tasks and update the checklist.
- Repeat join and review process until all criteria are met.

## 6. Appendices

### 6.1. Example Checklist Entry
```markdown
| Phase | Task | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| 1     | Implement AllowedPaths | Complete | All tests pass |
| 2     | Develop read_file tool | Partial  | Needs more edge case tests |
| 3     | Protocol integration   | None     | Not started |
```

### 6.2. Example Remediation Task
```markdown
- Task: Fix path validation to handle symlinks correctly
- Status: None
- Notes: Identified during join task review; must add test for symlink traversal
```
