# Rust Rewriter: Generic Project Intake Prompt

Please describe your development effort (app, library, document, algorithm, etc.). You may provide as little as a name or as much detail as you wish.

If you have any reference material that should be used directly (copied or adapted), please provide it now. If not, say "none".

If you have any reference material that should be used only for style, structure, or level of detail (but not content), please provide it now. If not, say "none".

Preferred development language: **Rust**. If you have a strong reason to use another language, please explain your rationale.

Once you provide this information, I will help you develop a detailed architecture and a robust, parallelizable development plan.
